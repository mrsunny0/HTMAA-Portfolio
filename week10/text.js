"There is a growing trend to make things that make, and this class has inspired engineers and designers like \
<a href='https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines'>Jens Dyvik, Nordvik Helgesen</a> and many others to \
create customaizable and accessible machines that make machines. For this project, we used a template made by \
<a href='https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/machineweek'>Jake Read</a> who was similarly inspired by previous \
machines developed by previous makers, to create our own personal take of a machine."

var text2 = 
"The making pipeline adopted from Jake and Jen was quite unorthadox. The parametric design was focused on the \
<a href='https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/fabricatable-machines/blob/master/chamferrail/Fusion360/img/overview.jpg'>pinions</a>\
, aka the actuating units of the machine, whereas the machine body was designed freehand. This does give \
a lot of freedom to customize the machine's frame and structure, but overall was too unconstrained which led to \
some confusion within the team on how to move forward with our design. Ultimately, we took models from Jake's and \
Jens previous machines and tweaked them slightly."

var text3 = 
"The final design was made by <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/oscarrosello/index.html'>Oscar Rosello</a> \
and from there we used Fusion360's CAM interface to plan the milling process."


var text4 = 
"Similarly, our CAM files were adopted from Jake's <a href='a href='https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/jakeread/machineweek/tree/master/fab/fusion'>\
CAM</a>. What this really meant was choosing tool paths, speeds & feeds, but more importantly, clicking <i>\
hundreds</i> of holes, outlines, cutouts, etc. But for the sake of this project, we clicked away (for hours)."

var text5 = 
"The milling had some hiccups, but I will leave the explanation to my teammates \
<a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/annawb/week10.html'>Anna</a>, \
<a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/burhanazeem/week9/index.html'>Burhan</a>, \
and <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/safinahali/index.html'>Safinah</a>. Long \
story short, we broke 4 endmills, had poor consistency between file versions which led to misalignment bewteen \
parts, and missed holes and fixtures which we literally joined using screwdrivers."

var text6 =
"The end effector, aka, a modified Sirahcha bottle with a repurposed Nema motor pump, was made by \
<a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/kyungyunchoi/index.html'>Yun</a> and Safinah. The \
coming together of all the parts was a group effort, however major contribution by \
<a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/vparth/week10/MachineBuilding.html'>Vik</a>, and Oscar."

var text7 = 
"We really needed a break"

var text8 =
"The remaining members <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/CBA/people/seanhickey/weeks/10-machines/'>Sean</a>, \
<a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/agnes/10.html'>Agnes</a>, \
and <a href='http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.17/CBA/people/emilysa/week9/index.html'>Emily</a> work on the software \
and motor control. How this all came together at the end, is well, beyond my comprehension."
