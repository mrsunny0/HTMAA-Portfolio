the final cutout was less than desired as the wood made it hard to distinguish surface features. \
Similarly, the stepover value should have been reduced to 40-50% (instead of the default 95%) to get \
finner details in the surface quality. Likewise a smaller endmill (<1/4'') could be used for finer details as well."

Then scaled and modified for laptop or iPad use."
