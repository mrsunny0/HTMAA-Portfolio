"The goal of this work was to create a composite, namely a structure layered with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_laminate'>composite laminates</a> \
which together generate a reinforced material. Composites are created to provide engineering properties to a material, usually stiffness, strength, heat durability etc. \
and there are many <a href='http://www.fibreglast.com/product/glossary-of-terms-in-composites/Learning_Center'>parameters</a> that go into desining composites. \

Unrelated, I made a composite of the beloved microcontroller, <a href='../_week11/index.html#anchor-ATtiny'>ATtiny2/4/85</a>."

is a <a href='https://netcomposites.com/guide-tools/guide/manufacturing/wethand-lay-up/'>wet lay-up</a> work up which uses \
a curable resin, in this <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy'>epoxy</a>, to form a solid structure guided \
by the plies. The negative mold is generated either through compression molding or vacuuming, both of which evacuate any excess resin \
