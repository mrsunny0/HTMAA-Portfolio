"As a hobby, I've been playing around with sensors with small and \
portable form factors such as the Intel Edition. I have a growing interest in \
wearable technologies so I've been using off-the-shelf microcontrollers and sensors to start off with. \
The Intel Edison provides a modular platform to add analog inputs such as acceleration and gyration. Making a case \
for this square like module would hopefully make the design more slick and contained."

"Simple use of calipers and some scratch paper were used to calculate expected dimension of this case. A \
strap holder and insert teeth were added so that the case can be securely closed and straped on with a \
veclro belt"

var text3 = 
"The case was 3D printed using a clear resin from a FormLabs2 printer. \
The case had to be remodeled in order to compensate for the slight thickness added to the print during resin \
curing and distortion during the print. Offsets of 1-2 mm were enough to snuggly hold the Intel Edison \
in its case."
